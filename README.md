# Text Analysis Python Script

This Python script performs basic text analysis tasks such as counting words, lines, and characters in a text file. It also provides functionality to modify the content of the text file by replacing specific words or phrases with others.

## Dependencies

This script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Running the Script

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clonehttps://github.com/aachalvishwakarma00/Nebula-Nexus-test

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd text-analysis-python-script
   
3. Ensure you have a text file named `apple.txt` in the project directory. You can create your own text file or use an existing one. Make sure to replace `"C:\\Users\\achal\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\apple.txt"` in the `main()` function with the correct file path to your text file.

4. Run the script:


The script will read the content of the `apple.txt` file, perform text analysis tasks, and optionally modify the content if specified.

## Example Usage

For example, let's say you have a text file named `apple.txt` with the following content:

This is a sample text file.
It contains some words for testing.
